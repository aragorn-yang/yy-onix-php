				<td>The collection is a bibliographic collection (eg a series or set (Fr. s&eacute;rie)) defined and identified by a publisher, either
					on the product itself or in product information supplied by the publisher. The books in the collection generally share a subject,
					narrative, design style or authorship. They may may have a specific order, or the collection may be unordered

				<td>Collection &eacute;ditoriale</td>
				<td>The collection is a bibliographic collection defined and identified by a publisher, either on the product itself or in product
					information supplied by the publisher, where the books in the collection have no specific order, shared subject, narrative,
					style or shared authorship, and are grouped by the publisher largely for marketing purposes. The collection has many of the
					characteristics of an imprint or marque. Used primarily in French book publishing, to distinguish between &#8216;s&eacute;rie&#8217; (using the
					normal code 10) and &#8216;collection&#8217; (code 11), and where the collection &eacute;ditoriale is not an imprint

				<td>Ascribed collection</td>
				<td>The collection has been defined and identified by a party in the metadata supply chain other than the publisher, typically
					an aggregator.
